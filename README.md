# Real Time Electric Guitar Distortion Effect Modelling
This VST instrument provides a similar Big Muff distortion/fuzz effect to your electrical guitar with a Orange IR. This is a school project for learning and apply several DSP techniques.
##To Compile and Build and Run
You should install "JUCE framework". Then start to project on "Projucer". You can use the software as a VST plug-in only with DAW right now since the standalone version doesn't run properly. I am not planning to fix or release a standalone version of the project right now.
